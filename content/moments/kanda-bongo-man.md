Soukous from the late 80's, early 90's: Kanda Bongo Man
> "Kanda Bongo Man revolutionized soukous by encouraging guitar solos after every verse and even sometimes in the beginning of the song. His form of soukous gave birth to the kwassa kwassa dance rhythm where the hips move back and forth while the hands move to follow the hips."
