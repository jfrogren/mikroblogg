# kieranhealy.hugo

This is the code and much of the content for my website, http://kieranhealy.org. As detailed [in this post](http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/02/24/powered-by-hugo/) the site is created using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a very fast static site generator originally written by Steve Francia. The present version uses a modified version of the [Even Theme](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even).
